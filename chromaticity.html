        <h3>Step 0: Picking a Color Space</h3>
        <p>While the notions of chromaticity and gamut are general, every color space has a different gamut and the same light has different chromaticities in different color spaces. To be concrete, we will use a specific color space for this tutorial. Any color space will do, so we invite you to build your own and use it to drive the rest of the tutorial. We know that a color space is uniquely defined by its primaries and the reference white. For simplicity, we will assume CIE Standard Illuminant E (Equal-Energy White) as the reference white, and provide you three ways to pick the primaries.</p>

        <p>The plot below is the spectral locus in your RGB space. Hover over any point on the locus to reveal the coordinates of the corresponding spectral light. Recall what the coordinates mean: they represent the amount of primaries needed to match the color of that spectral light. In fact, any point in this space corresponds to a color, and the coordinates of the point represent the amount of primaries needed to match that color.</p>

      <div class="row">
        <p>Now toggle the "Show Chromaticities " switch. You will see a set of lines, each of which starts from the origin and goes through a spectral light. By simple geometry, we know that points on a line, while requiring different absolute amounts of RGB primaries (different coordinates in the RGB space), all have the same R:G:B ratio. This conclusion generalizes too any line, not just the lines that go through the locus.</p>
        <p>How do a color that's mixed from 1:2:4 units of RGB primaries and a color that's mixed from a 2:4:8 units of the primaries relate? Well, recall from the <a href="cone2cmf.html">previous tutorial</a> that the amount of a primary is directly proportional to the power of that primary. So the second color can be obtained by doubling the power of each primary in the first color; similarly, halving the power of each primary in the second color gets us the first color. Intuitively, lights that have the same primary quantity ratio are said to have the same "objective color quality" while differing in the intensity.</p>
        <p>More formally, we can calculate the primary ratio $r:g:b$ of a color and then normalize the ratio such that $r+g+b = 1$ (100%). The so-calculated $r, g, b$ values of a color are called the <b>chromaticities</b> of that color. Mathematically, the chromaticities of a color are calculated from its absolute quantity by:</p>
        <p>$r = \frac{R}{R+G+B},~~~g = \frac{G}{R+G+B},~~~b = \frac{B}{R+G+B}$.</p>
        <p>Each color now has an rgb triplet, representing the color's chromaticities. Similar to how we represent colors in the RGB space, we can also plot the colors using their chromaticities. The green curve in the chart above shows the chromaticities of the spectral lights. Hover over a chromaticity point and the corresponding RGB point on the same line; check the primary ratio in the tooltips and you can see that the primary ratio doesn't change when you plot a color using their chromacitities. Obviously, the exact chromaticity values of a color depend on the particular color space used to represent that color.</p>
        <p>Knowing the chromaticities of a color tells us the <b>inherent attribute</b> of the color, and we can make that color brighter or darker by increasing or decreasing the amount of the primaries <i>while keeping the chromaticities constant</i>. In many practical color applications such as color photography and digital displays, chromaticities of a color is what we strive to capture (in the case of photography) or reproduce (in the case of display), and we are almost never be able to capture/reproduce the exact intensity of light in the scene (think about the power of the sun!).</p>
        <p>Spin around the plot. Notice how all the spectral lights are now on the same plane. That's the natural implication of how chromaticities are defined: since we enforce $r+g+b=1$, all the colors in the chromaticity plot naturally lie on the $r+g+b=1$ plane. Toggle the "Show r+g+b=1 Plane" switch to convince yourself of that. If we were to define chromaticities such that $r+g+b=1.5$, all the colors will then lie on that plane. One way to think of the chromaticity plot is that we shoot rays from the origin to go through all the spectral lights, and then take a cut of all those lines with the $r+g+b=1$ plane. Mathematically, it is performing a perspective projection of the RGB colors onto the plane where the point of projection is the origin.</p>
        <p>Chromaticity is inherently a 3D concept, but since the chromaticities of all colors lie on one plane, we can represent them in a 2D plot. The convention is to project the $r+g+b=1$ plane onto the r-g plane, and the resulting plot is called the <i>rg-chromaciticy plot</i>. You should try to spin the 3D plot around to project yourself, and you can also toggle the "Project" switch, which does the projection for you.</p>

      <div class="row">
        <p>The chromaticity plot is very useful in helping us understand the limit of human color perception: what are all the colors that human can see? A straightforward idea is to construct every single real light one by one and find its color. While we can't really do that in practice, constructing a few lights that way helps us gain the intuition.</p>
        <p>We could think of the SPD of a light as the "recipe" of making that light by mixing different amount of spectral lights specified in the SPD. Let's start by mixing two lights. If you toggle the "Pick 2 Colors" switch, you can click 2 arbitrary points $\mathbf{A}$ and $\mathbf{B}$ along the RGB locus. What you will get is a line segmentation $\overline{\mathbf{AB}}$. Any point on $\overline{\mathbf{AB}}$ represents a color producible by mixing some portion of colors $\mathbf{A}$ and $\mathbf{B}$. While this might be intuitive, let's prove it rigorously; later we will rely more on intuition for generalization.</p>
        <p>Assuming that the two (spectral) lights you picked have a spectrum of $\Phi_1$ and $\Phi_2$, respectively, and their RGB triplets are $[R_1, G_1, B_1]$ and $[R_2, G_2, B_2]$, respectively. From simple <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convex_combination">convex geometry</a>, we know that any point $\mathbf{T}$ on the line segment between the two points can be expressed as $[R_t, G_t, B_t] = \alpha[R_1, G_1, B_1] + (1-\alpha)[R_2, G_2, B_2], \alpha \in [0, 1]$. We will show that $[R_t, G_t, B_t]$ is a color that can be produced by mixing two lights: $\alpha\Phi_1$ and $(1-\alpha)\Phi_1$. Nothing in the proof below relies on $\Phi_1$ and $\Phi_2$ being spectral, and so the conclusion applies to any lights (and two points in the RGB space).</p>
        <p>Based on how RGB triplets are calculated from the CMFs ($\bar{r(\lambda)}, \bar{g(\lambda)}, \bar{b(\lambda)}$), we have:</p>
        <p>
        $R_1 = \sum_{\lambda} \Phi_1(\lambda) \bar{r}(\lambda), G_1 = \sum_{\lambda} \Phi_1(\lambda) \bar{r}(\lambda), B_1 = \sum_{\lambda} \Phi_1(\lambda) \bar{r}(\lambda)\\$
        $R_2 = \sum_{\lambda} \Phi_2(\lambda) \bar{r}(\lambda), G_2 = \sum_{\lambda} \Phi_2(\lambda) \bar{r}(\lambda), B_2 = \sum_{\lambda} \Phi_2(\lambda) \bar{r}(\lambda)$
        </p>
        <p>The RGB triplet of the new light mixed from $\alpha\Phi_1$ and $(1-\alpha)\Phi_1$ is:</p>
        <p>
        $\sum_{\lambda} [\alpha\Phi_1(\lambda) + (1-\alpha)\Phi_2(\lambda)] \bar{r}(\lambda) = \alpha\sum_{\lambda} \Phi_1(\lambda)\bar{r}(\lambda) + (1-\alpha)\sum_{\lambda} \Phi_2(\lambda)\bar{r}(\lambda) = \alpha R_1 + (1-\alpha) R_2 = R_t\\$
        $\sum_{\lambda} [\alpha\Phi_1(\lambda) + (1-\alpha)\Phi_2(\lambda)] \bar{g}(\lambda) = \alpha\sum_{\lambda} \Phi_1(\lambda)\bar{g}(\lambda) + (1-\alpha)\sum_{\lambda} \Phi_2(\lambda)\bar{g}(\lambda) = \alpha G_1 + (1-\alpha) G_2 = G_t\\$
        $\sum_{\lambda} [\alpha\Phi_1(\lambda) + (1-\alpha)\Phi_2(\lambda)] \bar{b}(\lambda) = \alpha\sum_{\lambda} \Phi_1(\lambda)\bar{b}(\lambda) + (1-\alpha)\sum_{\lambda} \Phi_2(\lambda)\bar{b}(\lambda) = \alpha B_1 + (1-\alpha) B_2 = B_t$
        </p>
        <p>Q.E.D.</p>
        <p>The discussion above operates in the RGB space. How does the conclusion look like in the chromaticity plane? The line segment $\overline{\mathbf{AB}}$ in the RGB space is mapped to a line segment $\overline{\mathbf{ab}}$ in the chromaticity diagram. $\overline{\mathbf{ab}}$ connects two points $\mathbf{a}$ and $\mathbf{b}$, each representing the chromaticities of two spectral lights. Meanwhile, a point $\mathbf{T}$ on $\overline{\mathbf{AB}}$ gets mapped to a point $\mathbf{t}$ on $\overline{\mathbf{ab}}$. $\mathbf{t}$ represents the chromaticities of color $\mathbf{T}$. In general, if we connect any two points $\mathbf{a}$ and $\mathbf{b}$ in the chromaticity diagram and form a line segment $\overline{\mathbf{ab}}$, points on $\overline{\mathbf{ab}}$ represent the <i>chromaticities</i> of all the colors that can be produced from two lights whose chromaticities are $a$ and $b$, respectively.</p>
        <p>The same intuition applies to three colors. Toggle the "Pick 3 Colors" switch, and pick three colors on the RGB spectral locus, which will form a triangle. Any point on that triangle represents a color that is produced from mixing the three chosen spectral lights. That triangle is mapped to another triangle in the chromaticity diagram. In general, if you pick three colors $\mathbf{a}$, $\mathbf{b}$, and $\mathbf{c}$ in the chromaticity diagram, the triangle $\triangle \mathbf{abc}$ contains the chromaticities of all the colors that can be produced from three lights whose chromaticities are $\mathbf{a}$, $\mathbf{b}$, and $\mathbf{c}$, respectively.</p>
        <p>Let's try one more. Toggle the "Pick 4 Colors" switch and pick four colors on the RGB spectral locus. What you get is a tetrahedron. Any point within that tetrahedron represents a color that is produced from mixing the four chosen spectral lights. That tetrahedron is mapped to a polygon quadrilateral in the chromaticity diagram. In general, if you pick four colors $\mathbf{a}$, $\mathbf{b}$, $\mathbf{c}$, and $\mathbf{d}$ in the chromaticity diagram, the quadrilateral $\square \mathbf{abcd}$ contains the chromaticities of all the colors that can be produced from four lights whose chromaticities are $\mathbf{a}$, $\mathbf{b}$, $\mathbf{c}$, and $\mathbf{d}$, respectively.</p>
        <p>We can keep playing this game. If a light is made of five spectral lights, its color chromaticities will fall in the pentagon formed by the five lights; if a light is made of six spectral lights, its color chromaticities will fall in the hexagon formed by the six spectral lights. Essentially, given a light's SPD $\Phi$, we can find its constituting spectral lights, and then form a polygon whose vertices are the chromaticities of those spectral colors. $\Phi$'s chromaticities are guaranteed to be within that polygon.</p>
        <p>If we exhaust all combinations of all wavelengths in the visible spectrum, we will have found all the colors. What's the geometric structure that contains all the visible colors? If you think about it, it's not difficult to see that the chromaticities of all colors must reside in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convex_hull">convex hull</a> of the spectral locus in the chromaticity diagram. Click the button "Show Human Visible Gamut in Chromaticity Diagram" to reveal it. We call all the colors that we can see the <b>gamut</b> of human color vision.</p>
        <p>Visualizing the gamut of human color vision in chromaticity is nice because we can constrain the gamut to a small area. Needless to say, however, the actual gamut of human color vision is 3D. How does it look like? We can't possible visualize it, because you can just keep increasing the power of the light and you will get infinite amount of colors &#8212; ignore the fact that high-intensity lights destroy retinas for a moment. But we can get a sneak peak of its bounds in the RGB space. Toggle the "Show Human Visible Gamut Boundary in RGB" switch. It will show the boundary of the gamut in the RGB space. The boundary grows forever, but we stop at the chromaticity locus. Any point within the boundary is a real color, i.e., a part of the human visual gamut.</p>
        <p>One final note, if you use the preset spectral lights as the primaries, the locus itself is convex. Therefore, the gamut is the area enclosed by the locus. However, it's possible to use primaries such that the spectral locus isn't convex, in which case we can't say that the human gamut is the area under the locus. The exact shape of gamut in both RGB and the chromaticity plot varies with the particular RGB color space you built. Try changing the primaries in Step 0 and visualize the gamut (the reference white in this tutorial is fixed).</p>

        <h3>Step 3: Physically-Unrealizable Lights and Imaginary Colors</h3>
        <p>We know that points on the locus are colors of spectral lights, and points inside the locus are colors that can be produced by mixing different spectral lights. What about points outside the locus? Intuitively, they do not represent any real color since they can't be produced by mixing spectral lights, but exactly what are they? For simplicity, we will use the color space built from the preset primaries (and EEW as reference white) for this part.</p>
        <p><b>Physically-Realizable Lights.</b> Lights whose SPDs are non-negative everywhere are physically-realizable. We can, in theory, generate such lights by collecting photons at different wavelengths as specified by the SPD. The RGB triplet of a physically-realizable light corresponds to a real color. As discussed above, a real color is a part of the gamut of human color perception; in the chromaticity diagram, a real color falls within the area under the locus if the locus is convex, which is the case here.</p>
        <p>Since photons always have positive energy, a "light" would be physically unrealizable if its SPD is negative at certain wavelengths. Mathematically, however, nothing prevents us from calculating the RGB triplet of a physically-unrealizable light using the CMFs of a color space. An RGB point would not represent a real color if the RGB triplet can not be producible from <i>any</i> physically-realizable light. We call such a color an <i>imaginary color</i>.</p>
        <p><b>Finding Imaginary Colors.</b> Given an RGB color space, can you find all the imaginary colors, those that can never be generated from real lights? Intuitively, any point outside the gamut is an imaginary color. Mathematically stated, given an RGB point $[R_t, G_t, B_t]$ in a color space whose CMFs are $\bar{r}(\lambda), \bar{g}(\lambda), \bar{b}(\lambda)$, we want to know whether the following <i>constrained</i> system of equations have a solution:<p>
        <p>$
          \begin{bmatrix}
          R_t \\
          G_t \\
          B_t
          \end{bmatrix} =
          \begin{bmatrix}
          \bar{r}(380) & \cdots \bar{r}(500) & \cdots & \bar{r}(780) \\
          \bar{g}(380) & \cdots \bar{g}(500) & \cdots & \bar{g}(780) \\
          \bar{b}(380) & \cdots \bar{b}(500) & \cdots & \bar{b}(780)
          \end{bmatrix}
          \times
          \begin{bmatrix}
          \Phi(380) \\
          \cdots \\
          \Phi(500) \\
          \cdots \\
          \Phi(780)
          \end{bmatrix}
          $, $\Phi(\lambda) \ge 0 ~~ \forall \lambda \in [380, 780] $, where $\Phi(\lambda)$ is the SPD to be solved for.

        <p>If not, $[R_t, G_t, B_t]$ is an imaginary color.</p>

        <p>Interestingly but perhaps unsurprisingly, it is possible that a real light and a unreal light are mapped to the same RGB point. This is because the system of equations above is under-determined. It could have two solutions, one meets the non-negative constraints and the other does not. That is, a real light can be a metamer of a unreal light, mathematically!</p>
