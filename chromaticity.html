        <h3>Step 0: Picking a Color Space</h3>
        <p>While the notions of chromaticity and gamut are general, every color space has a different gamut and the same light has different chromaticities in different color spaces. To be concrete, you will need a specific color space for this tutorial. We invite you to build your own and use it to drive the rest of the tutorial. We know that a color space is uniquely defined by its primaries and the reference white. For simplicity, we will assume CIE Standard Illuminant E (Equal-Energy White) as the reference white, and provide you four ways to pick the primaries.</p>

          <li><input type="radio" value="usePreset2" name="prim"><label for="usePreset2">&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Use Preset 2</b></label>: spectral lights $415~nm$, $500~nm$, and $540~nm$. Use this option if you want to explore a counter-intuitive color space (see Step 2.4).</li>

Recall what the coordinates mean: they represent the amount of primaries needed to match the color of that spectral light. In fact, any point in this space corresponds to a color, and the coordinates of the point represent the amount of primaries needed to match that color.</p>

        <p>Now toggle the "Show Locus in Chromaticity" switch. You will see a set of lines, each of which starts from the origin and goes through a spectral light. By simple geometry, we know that points on a line, while requiring different absolute amounts of RGB primaries (different coordinates in the RGB space), all have the same R:G:B ratio. This conclusion generalizes too any line, not just the lines that go through the locus.</p>
        <p>How do a color that's mixed from 1:2:4 units of RGB primaries and a color that's mixed from a 2:4:8 units of the primaries relate? Well, recall from the <a href="cone2cmf.html">previous tutorial</a> that the amount of a primary is directly proportional to the power of that primary. So the second color can be obtained by doubling the power of each primary in the first color; similarly, halving the power of each primary in the second color gets us the first color. Intuitively, lights that have the same primary quantity ratio are said to have the same "objective color quality" while differing in the intensity.</p>
        <p>More formally, we can calculate the primary ratio $r:g:b$ of a color and then normalize the ratio such that $r+g+b = 1$ (100%). The so-calculated $r, g, b$ values of a color are called the <b>chromaticities</b> of that color. Mathematically, the chromaticities of a color are calculated from its absolute quantity by:</p>
        <p>$r = \frac{R}{R+G+B},~~~g = \frac{G}{R+G+B},~~~b = \frac{B}{R+G+B}$.</p>
        <p>Each color now has an rgb triplet, representing the color's chromaticities. Similar to how we represent colors in the RGB space, we can also plot the colors using their chromaticities. The green curve in the chart above shows the chromaticities of the spectral lights. Hover over a chromaticity point and the corresponding RGB point on the same line; check the primary ratio in the tooltips and you can see that the primary ratio doesn't change when you plot a color using their chromacitities. Obviously, the exact chromaticity values of a color depend on the particular color space used to represent that color.</p>
        <p><b>Why Chromaticity?</b> Knowing the chromaticity of a color tells us the <b>inherent attribute</b> of the color, and we can make that color brighter or darker by increasing or decreasing the amount of the primaries <i>while keeping the chromaticity constant</i>. In many practical color applications such as color photography and digital displays, chromaticities of a color is what we strive to capture (in the case of photography) or reproduce (in the case of display), and we are almost never be able to capture/reproduce the exact intensity of light in the scene (think about the power of the sun!).</p>
        <p><b>Chromaticity Diagram.</b> Spin around the plot. Notice how all the spectral lights are now on the same plane. That's the natural implication of how chromaticities are defined: since we enforce $R+G+B=1$, all colors' chromaticities naturally lie on the $R+G+B=1$ plane. Toggle the "Show R+G+B=1 Plane" switch to convince yourself of that. If we were to define chromaticity such that $R+G+B=1.5$, all the colors will then lie on that plane. One way to think of chromaticities is that we shoot rays from the origin to go through all the spectral lights, and then intersect all those lines using the $R+G+B=1$ plane. Geometrically, this is equivalent to a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3D_projection#Perspective_projection">perspective projection</a> of the RGB colors onto the $R+G+B=1$ plane with the origin as the point of projection.</p>
        <p>Chromaticity is inherently a 3D concept, but since the chromaticities of all colors lie on one plane, we can represent them in a 2D plot. The convention is to project the $R+G+B=1$ plane onto the r-g plane, and the resulting plot is called the <i>rg-chromaciticy plot</i>. You should try to spin the 3D plot around to project yourself, and you can also toggle the "Project" switch, which does the projection for you.</p>

        <p>The chromaticity plot is useful in helping us understand the limit of human visual system (HVS) and the limit of a particular color space: what are all the colors that human can see, and can a color space produce all the colors that human can see? To answer these questions, one could construct every single real light one by one and find its color. While we can't really do that in practice, constructing a few lights that way would help us build the intuition.</p>

        <h4>2.1 Building the Intuition</h4>
        <p><b>Mixing Two Lights.</b> 
        We could think of the SPD of a light as the "recipe" of making that light &#8212; by mixing different amount of spectral lights specified in the SPD. Let's start by mixing two lights and see what happens to the resulting color. If you toggle the "Pick 2 Colors" switch, you can click 2 arbitrary points $\mathbf{A}$ and $\mathbf{B}$ along the RGB locus. What you will get is a line segmentation $\overline{\mathbf{AB}}$. Any point on $\overline{\mathbf{AB}}$ represents a color producible by mixing some portion of colors $\mathbf{A}$ and $\mathbf{B}$.

        </p>
        <div class="collapse" id="collapseExample">
          <div class="card card-body">
            <p>Assuming that the two (spectral) lights you picked have a spectrum of $\Phi_1$ and $\Phi_2$, respectively, and their RGB triplets are $[R_1, G_1, B_1]$ and $[R_2, G_2, B_2]$, respectively. From simple <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convex_combination">convex geometry</a>, we know that any point $\mathbf{T}$ on the line segment between the two points can be expressed as $[R_t, G_t, B_t] = \alpha[R_1, G_1, B_1] + (1-\alpha)[R_2, G_2, B_2], \alpha \in [0, 1]$. We will show that $[R_t, G_t, B_t]$ is a color that can be produced by mixing two lights: $\alpha\Phi_1$ and $(1-\alpha)\Phi_1$. Note that nothing in the proof below relies on $\Phi_1$ and $\Phi_2$ being spectral, and so the conclusion applies to any lights (and two points in the RGB space).</p>
            <p>Based on how RGB triplets are calculated from the CMFs ($\bar{r(\lambda)}, \bar{g(\lambda)}, \bar{b(\lambda)}$), we have:</p>
            <p>
            $R_1 = \sum_{\lambda} \Phi_1(\lambda) \bar{r}(\lambda), G_1 = \sum_{\lambda} \Phi_1(\lambda) \bar{r}(\lambda), B_1 = \sum_{\lambda} \Phi_1(\lambda) \bar{r}(\lambda)\\$
            $R_2 = \sum_{\lambda} \Phi_2(\lambda) \bar{r}(\lambda), G_2 = \sum_{\lambda} \Phi_2(\lambda) \bar{r}(\lambda), B_2 = \sum_{\lambda} \Phi_2(\lambda) \bar{r}(\lambda)$
            </p>
            <p>The RGB triplet of the new light mixed from $\alpha\Phi_1$ and $(1-\alpha)\Phi_1$ is:</p>
            <p>
            $\sum_{\lambda} [\alpha\Phi_1(\lambda) + (1-\alpha)\Phi_2(\lambda)] \bar{r}(\lambda) = \alpha\sum_{\lambda} \Phi_1(\lambda)\bar{r}(\lambda) + (1-\alpha)\sum_{\lambda} \Phi_2(\lambda)\bar{r}(\lambda) = \alpha R_1 + (1-\alpha) R_2 = R_t\\$
            $\sum_{\lambda} [\alpha\Phi_1(\lambda) + (1-\alpha)\Phi_2(\lambda)] \bar{g}(\lambda) = \alpha\sum_{\lambda} \Phi_1(\lambda)\bar{g}(\lambda) + (1-\alpha)\sum_{\lambda} \Phi_2(\lambda)\bar{g}(\lambda) = \alpha G_1 + (1-\alpha) G_2 = G_t\\$
            $\sum_{\lambda} [\alpha\Phi_1(\lambda) + (1-\alpha)\Phi_2(\lambda)] \bar{b}(\lambda) = \alpha\sum_{\lambda} \Phi_1(\lambda)\bar{b}(\lambda) + (1-\alpha)\sum_{\lambda} \Phi_2(\lambda)\bar{b}(\lambda) = \alpha B_1 + (1-\alpha) B_2 = B_t$

            <p>Q.E.D.</p>
          </div>
        </div>
        <p>How does the mixed color look like in chromaticity? The line segment $\overline{\mathbf{AB}}$ in the RGB space is mapped to a line segment $\overline{\mathbf{ab}}$ in the chromaticity plane. $\overline{\mathbf{ab}}$ connects two points $\mathbf{a}$ and $\mathbf{b}$, which represent the chromaticity of two spectral colors $\mathbf{A}$ and $\mathbf{B}$, respectively. Meanwhile, a point $\mathbf{T}$ on $\overline{\mathbf{AB}}$ gets mapped to a point $\mathbf{t}$ on the chromaticity plane. $\mathbf{t}$ represents the chromaticity of color $\mathbf{T}$. Where is $\mathbf{t}$? $\mathbf{t}$ will be within $\overline{\mathbf{ab}}$ if $\overrightarrow{\rm \mathbf{OA}}$ and $\overrightarrow{\rm \mathbf{OB}}$ <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Line%E2%80%93plane_intersection">intersect</a> the $R+G+B=1$ plane either both positively or both negatively ($\mathbf{O}$ is the origin). Informally, this requires that $\mathbf{A}$ and $\mathbf{B}$ are both below or both above the $R+G+B=0$ plane. Toggle the "Show R+G+B=0 Plane" and spin the plot to convince yourself.</p>
<div class="card mb-3">
<div class="card-body">
        In general, if the condition is met that <i>all the spectral colors are all above or all below the $R+G+B=0$ plane</i>, there exists a very powerful interpretation of the chromaticity diagram: connect any two points $\mathbf{a}$ and $\mathbf{b}$ in the chromaticity diagram and form a line segment $\overline{\mathbf{ab}}$, points on $\overline{\mathbf{ab}}$ represent the <i>chromaticities</i> of all the colors that can be produced by mixing two colors whose chromaticities are $\mathbf{a}$ and $\mathbf{b}$, respectively.
</div>
</div>
	<p>Visualizations of the spectral locus you can find on the Internet usually in a color space where the primaries are carefully picked such that the condition above is met. The CIE XYZ color space and the LMS cone space meet this condition, too. The primary choice in Preset 1 is one such example. We will assume such a color space for now. In Step 2.3, we will explain what happens when you build a color space that does not meet the above condition.</p>
        <p><b>Mixing Three Lights.</b> The same intuition applies to three colors. Toggle the "Pick 3 Colors" switch, and pick three colors on the RGB spectral locus, which will form a triangle. Any point on that triangle represents a color that is produced from mixing the three chosen spectral lights. That triangle is mapped to another triangle in the chromaticity diagram. In general, if you pick three colors $\mathbf{a}$, $\mathbf{b}$, and $\mathbf{c}$ in the chromaticity diagram, the triangle $\triangle \mathbf{abc}$ contains the chromaticities of all the colors that can be produced from three lights whose chromaticities are $\mathbf{a}$, $\mathbf{b}$, and $\mathbf{c}$, respectively.</p>
        <p><b>Mixing Four Lights. </b>Let's try one more. Toggle the "Pick 4 Colors" switch and pick four colors on the RGB spectral locus. What you get is a tetrahedron. Any point within that tetrahedron represents a color that is produced from mixing the four chosen spectral lights. That tetrahedron is mapped to a quadrilateral in the chromaticity diagram. In general, if you pick four colors $\mathbf{a}$, $\mathbf{b}$, $\mathbf{c}$, and $\mathbf{d}$ in the chromaticity diagram, the quadrilateral $\square \mathbf{abcd}$ contains the chromaticities of all the colors that can be produced from four lights whose chromaticities are $\mathbf{a}$, $\mathbf{b}$, $\mathbf{c}$, and $\mathbf{d}$, respectively.</p>
        <h4>2.2 Color Perception Limit of Human Visual System (HVS)</h4>
        <p><b>Generalization.</b> We can keep playing this game. If a light is made of five spectral lights, its chromaticity will fall in the pentagon formed by the five lights; if a light is made of six spectral lights, its chromaticity will fall in the hexagon formed by the six spectral lights. Essentially, given a light's SPD $\Phi$, we can find its constituting spectral lights, which form a polygon in the chromaticity diagram. The chromaticity of $\Phi$ falls in the polygon.</p>
        <p>If we exhaust all combinations of all wavelengths in the visible spectrum, we will have found all possible colors, which we call the <b>gamut of human color vision</b>. What's the geometric structure of the gamut? Generalizing the intuition we have built so far, it's not difficult to see that the chromaticities of all colors must reside in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convex_hull">convex hull</a> of the spectral locus in the chromaticity diagram. Click the button "Show HVS gamut in Chromaticity" to reveal it. If you choose the Preset 1 primaries, it happens to be the case that the spectral locus itself is a convex set, in which case the gamut is simply the area under the locus.</p>
        <p><b>Gamut is a 3D Concept.</b> Visualizing the gamut of human color vision in chromaticity is nice, but the actual gamut of human color vision is 3D. How does it look like? We can't possible visualize it, because you can just keep increasing the power of the light and you will get infinite amount of colors &#8212; ignore the fact that high-intensity lights destroy retinas for a moment. But we can get a sneak peak of its bounds in the RGB space. Toggle the "Show HVS Gamut Boundary in RGB" switch. It will show the boundary of the gamut in the RGB space. The boundary grows forever, but we stop at the chromaticity locus. Any point within the boundary is a real color, i.e., a part of the human visual gamut.</p>
        <h4>2.3 Gamut of a Color Space</h4>
        <p>Many lights that enter our eyes are not natural lights, but lights from various light-generating devices such as smartphones, computers, and printed paper. Each output device has its own color space, such as sRGB, CMYK, and DCI-P3. All the colors that can be produced by a color space is called the <b>gamut of the color space</b>. Is there a color space that can produce all the colors?</p>
        <p>The answer is no, and we can have a very intuitive explanation. Look at the chromaticity diagram of the color space built using the Preset 1 primaries. No matter what colors and how many colors you choose as primaries to build a color space, the primaries of any color space must reside inside the spectral locus, and all the colors that are producible from that color space must be inside the polygon formed by the primaries. Since the spectral locus is convex, the polygon is guaranteed to be enclosed by the locus. Therefore, the gamut of any color space is guaranteed to be a subset of the color gamut of HVS. In addition, since the polygon is always enclosed by the locus, it's impossible to find a polygon that includes all the spectral colors. That is, no color space can produce all spectral colors.</p>
        <p>These conclusions, however, apply only to color spaces whose primaries are real colors. If a color space, such as CIE XYZ, LMS, and ProPhoto RGB, uses imaginary primaries, its color gamut could include imaginary colors and thus is not a subset of HVS gamut. The color gamut of CIE XYZ completely covers the entire HVS gamut (and by extension all the spectral colors). We will explore the formation and properties of CIE XYZ color space in another tutorial.</p>
        <h4>2.4 Visualizing a Counter-Intuitive Color Space</h4>
	<p>The primaries in Preset 1 lead to a color space where the spectral colors are all above the $R+G+B=0$ plane. However, that condition is not always met for any arbitrary choice of primaries. Preset 2 is a counter-example. Select that preset and compare the RGB locus points with the $R+G+B=0$ plane. Then pick two colors $\mathbf{A}$ and $\mathbf{B}$, one above and the other below the $R+G+B=0$ plane. You will see that a point on $\overline{\mathbf{AB}}$ won't be mapped to a point on $\overline{\mathbf{ab}}$ by projecting through the origin.</p>
        <p>Also try showing the locus in chromaticity; see how weird that locus becomes. This could initially seem odd; how could a nice smooth curve in RGB become so entangled in the rgb space? The reason is that the transformation from RGB to rgb isn't linear (or affine for that matter); it's a perspective transformation.</p>
        <p>Nothing is wrong with a color space where spectral colors are separate by the $R+G+B=0$ plane. It just means we can't use the chromaticity diagram to easily reason about the effect of mixing colors in that color space. For instance, we can't say the HVS gamut in such a color space is the area under the convex hull of the locus. It's also possible to pick three spectral colors such that the resulting triangle in chromaticity contains other spectral colors. It doesn't mean all of a sudden we can build a RGB color space that can produce spectral colors. The conclusion that no spectral colors can be expressed by a RGB color space still holds, because it's tied to the inherent properties of color, which won't change with how we represent colors; it's just we can't intuitively draw that conclusion by simply looking at the locus in chromaticity.</p>
        <!--<p>One final note, if you use the preset spectral lights as the primaries, the locus itself is convex. Therefore, the gamut is the area enclosed by the locus. However, it's possible to use primaries such that the spectral locus isn't convex, in which case we can't say that the human gamut is the area under the locus. The exact shape of gamut in both RGB and the chromaticity plot varies with the particular RGB color space you built. Try changing the primaries in Step 0 and visualize the gamut (the reference white in this tutorial is fixed).</p>-->

        <h3>Step 3: Physically-Unrealizable Lights and Imaginary Colors</h3>
        <p>We know that points on the locus are colors of spectral lights, and points inside the locus are colors that can be produced by mixing different spectral lights. What about points outside the locus? Intuitively, they do not represent any real color since they can't be produced by mixing spectral lights, but exactly what are they? For simplicity, we will use the color space built from the preset primaries (and EEW as reference white) for this part.</p>
        <p><b>Physically-Realizable Lights.</b> Lights whose SPDs are non-negative everywhere are physically-realizable. We can, in theory, generate such lights by collecting photons at different wavelengths as specified by the SPD. The RGB triplet of a physically-realizable light corresponds to a real color. As discussed above, a real color is a part of the gamut of human color perception; in the chromaticity diagram, a real color falls within the area under the locus if the locus is convex, which is the case here.</p>
        <p>Since photons always have positive energy, a "light" would be physically unrealizable if its SPD is negative at certain wavelengths. Mathematically, however, nothing prevents us from calculating the RGB triplet of a physically-unrealizable light using the CMFs of a color space. An RGB point would not represent a real color if the RGB triplet can not be produced from <i>any</i> physically-realizable light. We call such a color an <i>imaginary color</i>.</p>
        <p><b>The Math of Imaginary Colors.</b> Given an RGB color space, can you find all the imaginary colors, those that can never be generated from real lights? Intuitively, you could probably tell that any point outside the gamut is an imaginary color, but let's reason about this a bit more rigorously. Mathematically stated, given an RGB point $[R_t, G_t, B_t]$ in a color space whose CMFs are $\bar{r}(\lambda), \bar{g}(\lambda), \bar{b}(\lambda)$, we want to know whether the following <i>constrained</i> system of equations have a solution:<p>
        <p>$
          \begin{bmatrix}
          R_t \\
          G_t \\
          B_t
          \end{bmatrix} =
          \begin{bmatrix}
          \bar{r}(380) & \cdots \bar{r}(500) & \cdots & \bar{r}(780) \\
          \bar{g}(380) & \cdots \bar{g}(500) & \cdots & \bar{g}(780) \\
          \bar{b}(380) & \cdots \bar{b}(500) & \cdots & \bar{b}(780)
          \end{bmatrix}
          \times
          \begin{bmatrix}
          \Phi(380) \\
          \cdots \\
          \Phi(500) \\
          \cdots \\
          \Phi(780)
          \end{bmatrix}
          $, $\Phi(\lambda) \ge 0 ~~ \forall \lambda \in [380, 780] $, where $\Phi(\lambda)$ is the SPD to be solved for.
        </p>
        <p>If not, $[R_t, G_t, B_t]$ is an imaginary color. Without the constraint that the SPD is non-negative at every wavelength, this system of equations is under-determined and so has infinitely many solutions. But with the constraint, it's possible that there's no solution.</p>
        <p><b>Finding Imaginary Colors.</b> You can verify this for yourself. Look at the gamut on the right and use your intuition to identify a point that you believe should be an imaginary color. Then put the RGB coordinates of that point in the input boxes below, and hit the "Find SPD" button. One of two things will happen.</p>
        <div>
          <ul>
            <li>If the color is a real color (think harder!), there are many spectra that could have led to that particular RGB triplet; we plot the one that has the least total power. You will see that the RGB point falls within the gamut and the chromaticity is within the convex hull of the spectral locus.</li>
            <li>If the color is indeed an imaginary color (great job!), there isn't a real light that could lead to that RGB point, but a physically-unrealizable light could. To convince yourself of this, click the "Find an Unreal Light" button. A light that mathematically gives the target RGB triplet but with negative SPD values is plotted. You will also see that the RGB triplet is outside the gamut and the chromaticity is outside the convex hull of the locus.</li>

        <p><b>Real and Unreal Lights Could Generate the "Same Color".</b> Interestingly but perhaps unsurprisingly, it is possible that a real light and a unreal light are mapped to the same RGB point.
